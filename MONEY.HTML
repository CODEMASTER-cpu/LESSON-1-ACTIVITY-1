        <H1>WHAT IS MONEY???</H1>
        <P><B>Money is a widely accepted medium of exchange that facilitates transactions in an economy. It acts as a common unit of
        account, allowing people to compare the values of goods and services, and it also serves as a store of value, allowing
        people to save and use their money later.</B></P>

                    <H1>WHAT IS IMPORTANCE OF MONEY???</H1>
                    <P>Money allows us to meet our basic needsâ€”to buy food and shelter and pay for healthcare. Meeting these needs is
                    essential, and if we don't have enough money to do so, our personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of the community as a
                    whole suffers greatly.</P>  </ARTICLE>

                    <H1>EVOLUTION OF MONEY</H1>
                    <P>The Evolution of Money
                    Barter Systems: Before the invention of money, people relied on barter systems to trade goods and services. Barter
                    involved exchanging one type of good or service for another, but it was inefficient and limited by the double
                    coincidence of wants.<BR>
                    
                    
                    
                    Commodity Money: As societies evolved, they began using commodity money, which had intrinsic value in addition to its
                    value as a medium of exchange. Examples include shells, beads, salt, and grain, which were widely accepted in trade.<BR>
                    
                    
                    
                    Metal Coins: The introduction of metal coins marked a significant advancement in the history of money. Metal coins were
                    durable, portable, and easily divisible, making them ideal for trade. The use of coins spread rapidly across
                    civilizations.<BR>
                    
                    
                    
                    Paper Money: Paper money originated in China during the Tang Dynasty and later spread to other parts of the world. Paper
                    money was initially backed by precious metals but later transitioned to fiat money, which is not backed by a physical
                    commodity but by the government's guarantee.<BR>
                    
                    
                    
                    Banking Systems: The development of banking systems allowed for the issuance of banknotes and the facilitation of
                    financial transactions. Banks played a crucial role in the development of modern economies by providing services such as
                    lending, deposit-taking, and money transfer.<BR>
                    
                    
                    
                    Digital Currencies: The rise of the internet and digital technologies has led to the emergence of digital currencies
                    such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These digital currencies operate independently of central banks and are
                    based on decentralized blockchain technology.<BR></P>
